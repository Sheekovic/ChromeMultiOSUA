# ChromeWinUA

ChromeWinUA is a lightweight Python module designed to generate realistic Google Chrome user agent strings for Windows 10 and Windows 11. It features dynamic version simulation, configurable settings, error handling, logging, caching, and basic unit testsâ€”all packaged in a modular, easy-to-integrate class.

## Features

- **Chrome-Only on Windows:**  
  Generates user agents strictly for Google Chrome on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

- **Dynamic Version Simulation:**  
  Simulates dynamic Chrome version generation within realistic ranges. (Replace with an API call for live data if needed.)

- **Configurable Settings:**  
  Easily configure allowed OS strings, version ranges, and other settings through a centralized configuration dictionary.

- **Robust Logging & Error Handling:**  
  Uses Python's built-in logging module to capture key events and errors.

- **Caching:**  
  Leverages caching to store previously generated user agents, improving performance for repeated requests.

- **Modular & Extensible:**  
  Encapsulated in a single class (`UserAgentGenerator`) for easy import and extension in other projects.

- **Basic Unit Testing:**  
  Includes simple unit tests to ensure the generator produces valid user agent strings.

## Installation

Clone this repository or download the module files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chrome-win-ua.git
```

Then, navigate into the directory:

```bash
cd chrome-win-ua
```

Install any required dependencies (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note:* This module is built for Python 3.6+.

## Usage

You can integrate the module into your projects as follows:

```python
from chrome_win_ua import UserAgentGenerator

# Create an instance of the generator
generator = UserAgentGenerator()

# Retrieve a user agent string
user_agent = generator.generate_user_agent()
print("Generated User Agent:")
print(user_agent)
```

For advanced usage, you can also pass a custom OS string (must be one of the allowed Windows options):

```python
custom_os = "Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64"  # or your preferred option from the config
user_agent = generator.generate_user_agent(custom_os)
print("Custom OS User Agent:")
print(user_agent)
```

## Configuration

Key settings can be found in the module's configuration dictionary. You can adjust:

- Allowed OS options (for Windows 10 and Windows 11)
- WebKit version
- Chrome version ranges (major, build, patch)

Feel free to modify these settings to fit your project requirements.
